This is my very slow-moving hobby kernel that I hack on in my spare time. Currently, nothing works! ðŸ˜Œ

## Toolchain

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - The cross compiler and other build tools are pulled as a Docker image during build time for reproducibility.
- [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/download) - I develop this on QEMU. Of course, you can also just burn the ISO and boot it on real metal.
